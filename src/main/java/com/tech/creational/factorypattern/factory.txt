## Factory pattern

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

In Plain words, It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

Use the Factory Method pattern when

* a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
* a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
* classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses,
and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate
