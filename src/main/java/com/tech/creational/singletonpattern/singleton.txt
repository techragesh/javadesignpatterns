Realtime Examples:

# Runtime.getRuntime()
# Spring Beans
# Logger

Disadvantages:

# Over usage and difficult to perform unit testing (difficult to handle in single jvm)
# Sometime confused with factory pattern

Notes:

Calender cal1 = Calender.getInstance()
Calender cal2 = Calender.getInstance()
This is not a singleton pattern. Its a factory one.
if we print cal1 and cal2 it will give two different instance.
I mean it will return different cal values.
